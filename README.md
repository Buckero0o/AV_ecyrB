I've just made an armor script for a friend and decided to release it to the public. This script has two sets of armor, a 50% that adds 50% of armor when used, The other is a 100% armor and will give you full armor on use, at the moment this script is an esx script I plan on making it compatable with most other frameworks like QB VRP ect.

1.0.1 ChangeLogs
Fixed where it wasn’t showing notification on use.
Took out “setpedarmor” and changed it to “addarmortoped”.
